<h3>SPECIAL TOPICS IN FINANCE AND RISK ENGINEERING</h3>
<h4>FIN-UY&nbsp;4903&nbsp;A</h4>
<h2><strong>Prof. Sandeep Jain</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Spring 2025</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>
<p>This course covers the theory and practice of Machine Learning and its fundamental applications in the field of Financial Engineering. Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning paradigms are discussed.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri , sans-serif;">The purpose is to become knowledgeable enough about the field to pursue individual topics further.&nbsp; In addition, the topics will include practical implementation of the techniques in Python on financial data or other sample data when financial data not available. Students are strongly encouraged to peruse, research and present recent developments on machine learning in Finance as part of their final project.</span></span></p>
<h3><strong>Objectives</strong></h3>
<p>The course introduces the student to the technical and algorithmic aspects of Machine Learning, with equal emphasis on understanding the principles (the why) as well as the methods (the how).</p>
<p>The problem domain is a variety of financial applications, such as model construction and calibration, price prediction, capital allocation, risk management, and trading strategy optimization.</p>
<p>At the end of the course, students will be in command of the basic tools and main financial concepts, to be able to successfully pass the quantitative interview process and start a career in the financial industry.</p>
<h3><strong>Structure</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Weekly lectures every Tuesday 6 pm-8:30pm (2 MetroTech Center Room 802)</li>
<li>Ten homework assignments accounting for 70% of total grade</li>
<li>Final exam, project-based, accounting for 30% of total grade</li>
<li>Credit for class participation (could make up for lapses in assignments)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lecture attendance and participation in the in-class exercises</li>
<li>Additional reading, as requested at each lecture</li>
<li>Homework&nbsp;and projects, to be submitted within the stated deadlines</li>
<li>
<p style="margin: 0.0in;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri , sans-serif;">The class will use Jupyter Notebooks and all students are expected to run code and do homeworks in that environment.</span></span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
<li>Intermediate linear algebra, calculus, and statistics</li>
<li>Basic knowledge of capital markets and financial instruments (bonds, equities, foreign exchange, simple options, market microstructure)</li>
<li>Intermediate Python programming (basic data structures and algorithms, functions and classes, modules and packages)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructors</h3>

<h3>Readings</h3>
<p>There is no main textbook, but the students get reading assignments from a variety of books (see references at the end). A significant portion of the course content overlaps A. Géron's "Hands-on machine learning" text, and students are strongly recommended to obtain a copy.</p>
<p>See the Syllabus for the reading for each week.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The main development environment is the Anaconda Python distribution, which is freely available. The distribution contains all the necessary packages and code development tools (IPython, Spyder, Jupyter). Public and commercial data sets are used for practice.</p>
